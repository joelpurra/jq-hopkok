## Original purpose

The library was built awaiting a jq module/package system, but also to collect shell utils for JSON manipulation. Some of these utils can be converted to packages, while others rely on external programs such as the `bash` shell.



## Dependencies

Most utils were written for jq v1.4, and some can be probably be significantly improved with v1.5+ features. When the time comes, the plan is to maintain a branch per jq version for backwards compatibility.

jq-hopkok's runtime dependencies:

- [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) v1.4+
- [`bash`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) v4+

Some utils also use:

- [GNU `parallel`](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/)

## TODO

*Patches/pull requests welcome!*

- Write tests.
- Break out jq scripts from shell scripts.
- Split up files into smaller parts.
